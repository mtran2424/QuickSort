# QuickSort
This repository contains an implementation of the QuickSort algorithm in C++. The QuickSort algorithm is one of the most widely used sorting algorithms and it works by selecting a pivot element and partitioning the array around the pivot, such that all elements less than the pivot are moved to the left of it, and all elements greater than the pivot are moved to the right of it. The pivot is then placed in its final position and the algorithm is recursively applied to the left and right sub-arrays until the entire array is sorted.

Usage:

'QuickSort.cpp' contains the quicksort, partition, and swap functions which implement the algorithm together, and an example of the algorithm execution in main().
